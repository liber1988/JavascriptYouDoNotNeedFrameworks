# CoffeeMasters Vanilla

This project is part of a training course focused on learning **Vanilla JavaScript** — without relying on any frameworks or libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice writing clean and modern JavaScript from scratch
- Understand core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, events, routing, and state
- Gain hands-on experience building a simple application using only browser-native APIs

## 📦 What's Inside

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Manual client-side routing
- Modular code structure
- No external dependencies

## 🚀 How to Run

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser — no build steps or installations required.

## 📚 Skills Practiced

- DOM traversal and manipulation
- Event handling
- SPA-like routing using `history.pushState`
- Code organization and modularization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)

---

This project is a learning exercise and is kept deliberately simple to better understand how things work under the hood — the way the browser sees it.
